# OCO: Permissions
Every OCO system user has one role assigned. The role defines which actions he is allowed to do. Roles are described as a JSON object in the database table `system_user_role`. By default, there is one role called "Superadmin" which allows everything.

This page describes the role architecture for system users. For domain user (self service) roles, please have a look at the [Self Service](Self-Service.md) page.

## Create Own R{o|u}les
You can create your own roles by adding a new role on the web frontend settings page with a JSON-ACL (Access Control List) string like the following.

**Please note:**
- for managing group memberships, the user needs `write` permissions on both the computer/package/report **and** the group.
- to create new packages, the user needs `create` permissions for packages in general and for the corresponding package family
- to create deployment jobs, the user needs `create` permissions for job containers in general and `deploy` permissions for the corresponding computer and package
- item (allow) permissions are inherited recursively through the group tree
  - example: a user can see all computers below a group he has `"item":{"read":true}` permissions for, even if the computer is inside a subgroup where he has no `read` permissions for (unless `"item":{"read":false}` is set)
