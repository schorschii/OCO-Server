# OCO: Web Application
The OCO web frontend allows you to manage computers & packages and view their details and relationships.

## Force Remove
When you try to remove a computer/package group with subgroups or a computer/package with pending jobs, the web frontend will abort the action and tell you that you first need to remove the subgroups/pending jobs.

You can force the deletion of the object by holding the shift key pressed when clicking on the "Remove" button. This will automatically delete all subgroups/pending jobs.

## Computer Commands / Client Extension
OCO has a feature called "Computer Commands" which allows you to seamlessly open VNC, RDP, SSH sessions with one click on the computer details page.

Additional commands can be provided by extensions. Please have a look at the "Extensions" sections for more information.

When clicking on a Computer Command button, a custom URL will be opened in your browser. In case of the pre-defined commands, this will be `vnc://HOSTNAME`, `rdp://HOSTNAME`, `ssh://HOSTNAME`, `ping://HOSTNAME` and `nmap://HOSTNAME`. You need an appropriate counterpart on your computer to handle this URLs. For the pre-defined commands, this will be the OCO Client Extension, which can be found in `/client-extension`. Please install it on your computer. After that, the Client Extension will handle the VNC, RDP and SSH URLs and open an appropriate program like Remmina to start the remote access.

It is recommended to visit the Github Releases Page to download a ready-to-use package which automatically installs the OCO Client Extension on your system. Alternatively, you can configure the Client Extension by yourself using the follwing information.

There is no port for macOS since macOS can handle `vnc://` and `ssh://` links out-of-the-box. `rdp://` links can be openened on macOS after installing the "Windows App" from the app store (formerly known as "Microsoft Remote Desktop").

### Linux XDG Configuration
Copy `oco-client-extension-linux.desktop` into `/usr/share/applications` and execute `update-desktop-database`. Copy `oco-client-extension-linux.py` into `/usr/bin`, make sure it is executable and check if Python 3 is working properly.

It is possible that another application already registered the `ssh://` protocol. Firefox lets you select the application which should be used to open these URLs but Chrome always uses the default application. In this case, you can set the OCO Client Extensions as default with: `xdg-settings set default-url-scheme-handler ssh oco-client-extension-linux.desktop`.

### Windows Configuration
Compile the Windows Client extension into an `.exe` using pyinstaller. Then, move the binary to `C:\Program Files\OCO Client Extension\oco-client-extension-windows.exe` and execute `oco-client-extension-windows.reg` to register the URL Schemes.

Now, install TightVNC and Nmap if you want to use VNC and Nmap. The Client Extensions expecting that those programs are installed in the default directories, so please do not change the installation directory.

## Message Of The Day (MOTD)
The message of the day is displayed on the OCO homepage and can be modified by setting the setting `motd` on the configuration page. This message is intentionally not escaped by htmlspecialchars() so you can format the text and insert links.

Suggestions for your MOTD:
```
I know what you did steve.
```
```

```
```

## Web UI Default Values
You can customize the default values of the deployment, package creation and other forms by editing the `default-*` values on the configuration page.
| Setting Key | Default Value |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| default-use-wol | false |
| default-shutdown-waked-after-completion | false |
| default-restart-timeout | 20 |
| default-auto-create-uninstall-jobs | true |
| default-force-install-same-version | false |
| default-abort-after-error | false |

## Web Design, Customizations, Extensions
You can customize the web design (e.g. to adapt your corporate design or to easily distinguish a test system from the production system) and functionality by creating OCO extensions with your desired CSS, JS and PHP scripts. Writing an extension ensures that your custom code is not overwritten with an update.

Please have a look at the docs and examples at [OCO-Extensions](https://github.com/schorschii/oco-server-extensions) for more information.
