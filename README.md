# Open Computer Orchestration
**Self Hosted / On Premise Desktop and Server Inventory, Management & Software Deployment**

The Open Computer Orchestration (OCO) project enables IT administrators to centrally manage Linux, macOS and Windows machines using a comfortable web interface. It provides software deployment features, a user-computer logon overview, lists software packages installed on each computer ("recognised software") and features a fine-grained permission/role system.

It focuses on easy usability (UI/UX), simplicity (assessable code with minimal external dependencies) and performance (you can manage many computers with minimal server resources).

These features allow you to roll out any new software or updates (patch management) - just create an OCO package and distribute it to your clients. You can track progress and view the results (exit code and command output) of every software job. Custom reports let you to get even more out of your data.

## About OCO Server
The OCO server provides the Agent API (used to communicate with the OCO agent), the [Client API](docs/Client-API.md) (can be used by admins to automate workflows, e.g. for Continuous Integration/Delivery/Deployment) and the admin web frontend for the OCO project. On the web frontend you can view computer details and configure software deployment jobs. It can be installed on any Linux distribution. Data is stored in a MariaDB database.
